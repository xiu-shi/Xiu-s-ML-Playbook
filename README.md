# 🧠 Xiu(Janet)'s ML Playbook

Welcome to my open-source Machine Learning playbook — a curated portfolio of projects that blend data-driven insights with real-world business applications.

This repository reflects my transition from SaaS QA leadership to data-powered consulting, focusing on human-centered AI, scalable ML workflows, and storytelling through code.
